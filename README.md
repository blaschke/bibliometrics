The idea of publication authorship contributes to bibliometric studies of scientific work and beyond.
It presents itself as a more fine-grained alternative to the notion of bibliographic coupling.

The illustration of publication authorship as opposed to bibliographic coupling involves several steps:

(1) Import, convert, and tidy bibliographic data downloaded from SCOPUS (01_import_convert_tidy_bibtex_data.R)
(2) Compute basic statistics (02_basic_statistics.R)
(3) Generate graphs (03_graphs.R) and supporting figures (e.g., boxplots)

Three data sets of publications from top-ten journals in accounting, astronomy, and gastroenterology in the years from 2010 to 2019 are used for the illustration.
The data sets may be downloaded from SCOPUS following instructions (00_download_scopus_data.txt).
